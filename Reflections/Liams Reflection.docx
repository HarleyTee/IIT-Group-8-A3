 Liam’s Reflection


So far in the assignment as a team, I think we have all worked well together. Communication has been clear and concise and there haven’t been any disagreements. It was the first time I have used discord and I quite like it, however, it, along with GitHub has taken me some time to get used to properly. Even though everything was online compared to a traditional university setting of seeing each other every week, the group assignment went quite smoothly. It was surprising to me how much technology can make meeting up in person almost redundant. If I could change anything about the online component it would be notifications to come from Discord and also the ability to be able to get the same free time as every other group member. We all have work/life commitments etc. so it can make it hard to catch each other all at a set time. I have learnt that with group work, it doesn’t matter if the team is seeing each other in person or it’s a digital connection, as long as there is clear communication it can make a large assignment which would otherwise be stressful, feel more seamless and easier to overcome.
