The group worked really well considering we are all relatively different. We were able to complete the tasks we assigned to ourselves, most people volunteering to do different portions of the tasks and we were able to assemble it in GitHub. As most people volunteered to complete different tasks we had no issues with task delegation or completion.
I feel like our communication could have been improved as we used discord as a tool to communicate, however this platform wasn’t suitable to everyone as a lot of people weren’t able to respond in a timely manner. Therefore there were delays in the how quickly we would complete task. 

I was surprised that everyone got over the learning curve that was Github and learnt to use new tools quickly. I found that really impressive because I’ve been in groups where the teams weren’t cohesive or willing to assist in the assignment. I was pleased with how we performed as a team, Daniel and Harley really were organised with GitHub they were the most knowledgable and confident with what they were doing and assisted those that weren’t familiar with the site. I Github’s log of activity doesn’t reflects how everyone worked as it takes into account the work done within the site and not outside it.
