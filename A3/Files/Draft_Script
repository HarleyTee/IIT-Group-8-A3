iPlantified is an smartphone based application designed to eliminate the painful process of losing household plants due to neglect or  lack of proper plant care.
iPlantified uses location based care suggestions tailored to your climate so if you are living in an apartment in the NT you won't be getting the same care as a house in Hobart.
We take into account the watering, light, soil composition, temperature, humidity and fertilisation rates when your plant plan is created ->
With the option to customise your watering schedules to fit your needs.
We have included mock ups of what our app design will look like and a detailed plan of how we would plan to implement these features.
When the plant and flower industry rakes in revenue of $15bn (https://www.ibisworld.com/united-states/market-research-reports/plant-flower-growing-industry/)
 and the Australian nursery industry brings in $726M (https://www.ibisworld.com.au/industry-trends/market-research-reports/agriculture-forestry-fishing/agriculture/nursery-production.html)
we have speculated that this app will have huge reach not only in the consumer/home use but can be scaled to business size with ease.
